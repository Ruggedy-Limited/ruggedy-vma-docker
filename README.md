## About Ruggedy VMA Docker

Ruggedy VMA (Vulnerability Management App) is an open source web application built by [Ruggedy Limited](http://ruggedy.io) in PHP, using the Laravel framework as a foundation.

It is built to assist pen testers, information security consultants, CISOs (Chief Information Security Officers), and anyone who is using tools like Burp, Nessus and Nexpose, to do network and server security testing.

In the simplest terms, the application does the following:
- Consumes XML scan output files generated by Burp, Nessus or Nexpose security scanners.
- Provides an approachable, consistent user interface (UI) for analysing the data found in these files.
- Allows you to add your own manual findings of vulnerabilities using the Ruggedy App, named after the company that built this software.
- Allows you to group Vulnerabilities into "Folders".
- Enables collaboration through "comments" on vulnerability records.
- Makes it easy to send vulnerability information directly into Jira as a "Bug" issue.

## Requirements

- Docker
- A running MySQL server with an empty database to use when installing the application

## Setup and Installation

- Run git clone https://github.com/Ruggedy-Limited/ruggedy-vma-docker.git
- It is REQUIRED that you open the /Files/.env file in an editor of your choice and configure your database connection: DB_HOST, DB_PORT, DB_DATABASE, DB_USERNAME, DB_PASSWORD.
- It is recommended that you customise the following options in the .env file: APP_ENV (local/development/production), APP_DEBUG (true/false), APP_URL (e.g. http://localhost).
- If you want the password reset functionality to send emails, configure your SMTP server in the .env file: MAIL_HOST, MAIL_PORT, MAIL_USERNAME, MAIL_PASSWORD, MAIL_ENCRYPTION, MAIL_FROM_NAME, MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS.

Now run the following commands from your shell while in the directory where the git repository was cloned: 
- Run `sudo docker build -t ruggedy/ruggedy .`
- Run `sudo docker run -it -p80:80 ruggedy/ruggedy`

If all of the above commands succeed, then the application should be installed, working and accessible via http://ip_address:80
A default admin user is installed with the following credentials:  
Username: **admin@localhost**  
Password: **password**

It is highly recommended that you amend these details by logging in and making the relevant changes by clicking the "Profile" menu option on the main menu that can be accessed by clicking the hamburger menu icon at the top-left of the screen. 

## Development Roadmap

This still needs to be clearly defined, but the immediate plans are to make some improvements to the XML parser and to create a single command setup process in the next couple of months.
